# Extra notes from pygame test 2 project
#
# create a surface and pass in a tuple containing its length and width
# my_surface = pygame.Surface((50, 50))
# give the surface a color to separate it from the background
# my_surface.fill((251, 73, 52))
# my_rectangle = my_surface.get_rect()

# .blit() stands for Block Transfer and .blit() is how you copy the contents of one Surface to another.
# .blit() takes two arguments: the Surface to draw and the location on the other Surface to draw the new one
# this line says "Draw surf onto the screen at the center"
# screen.blit(my_surface, (SCREEN_WIDTH/2, SCREEN_HEIGTH/2))
# pygame.display.flip()

# put the center of surf at the center of the display
# surface_center = (
#     (SCREEN_WIDTH - my_surface.get_width())/2,
#     (SCREEN_HEIGTH - my_surface.get_height())/2
# )

# draw player.surf at the new coordinates
# screen.blit(player.surf, player.rect)
